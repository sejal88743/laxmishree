## Core Features:

- Dashboard: Dashboard to display real-time data and alerts, with a card-based layout.
- Efficiency Page: Efficiency page to manage and record loom machine efficiency with shift-based data entry.
- Report Generator: Customizable report generator to provide detailed summaries of loom performance, including a grand total weft meter for the selected date range.
- Settings Configuration: Settings page to manage general settings, API keys, and data management.
- AI-Powered Scanning: Data Entry Automation: Scan a loom's output display via photo using the device camera and auto-populate relevant form fields using the Google Gemini API. The Gemini tool can process image data to extract Weft Meter, Machine No., Date, Time, Stops, Run and Total Time, greatly decreasing manual input time.
- WhatsApp Data Sharing: WhatsApp Integration: A button next to the low efficiency alert on the Dashboard, that, when pressed, sends date-wise efficiency data for all machines for the last 3 days, to a pre-configured WhatsApp number using a pre-configured message template.
- Offline Mode: Offline Storage: Ensure data can be accessed and input even when the device is offline. Utilize the browser's local storage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#663399) for a focused, efficient, and modern feel.
- Background color: Very light grey-indigo (#F0F0F5). It is of the same hue as the primary color but heavily desaturated and light to provide a neutral backdrop that supports data readability.
- Accent color: A vibrant blue-violet (#8A2BE2), slightly analogous to Deep Indigo but much brighter and more saturated, is to be used sparingly on interactive elements, highlights, and key data points, enhancing user focus.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif, for a neutral, readable, and contemporary look.
- Use colorful and clear icons to enhance usability. Follow a consistent style, with icons that complement the colorful UI elements.
- Compact, cut-to-cut design with no margins or unnecessary spacing, optimizing screen real estate, particularly on mobile.
- Subtle animations for feedback, such as loading states and successful form submissions.
